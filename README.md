The focus of this project was a simple implementation of CRUD using GO and MongoDB.


## Run

* To run MongoDB, use the command **docker-compose up** in the directory of the file docker-compose.yaml.

* To run Go, use the command **go run main.go** in the directory of the file main.go.

* Now the project is running in 8080 port

* You can see the swagger documentation in **http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html**

* You can generate a new swagger documentation using the comand **swag init --parseDependency --parseInternal --parseDepth 1**
